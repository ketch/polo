# Contributing to Polo

Here are some guidelines for contributing to Polo. It is great to have you
here. Here are a few ways you can help make this project better:

## Developer

Polo is mainly developed by [David Ketcheson](http://github.com/ketch).

## Documentation

At present, the only documentation is the Readme.md file and the function docstrings
in the source.

## Adding new features

If you want to add a new feature, I prefer that you: fork the repository, implement
your changes, and [issue a pull request](http://github.com/ketch/polo/compare).
It is best to discuss it with me first
(via the issue tracker) in order to make sure it fits within the project scope.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

# Bugs
This project is in a very early development stage and you will almost certainly
encounter bugs or unimplemented features.

* You can help report bugs by filing them here: https://github.com/ketch/polo/issues
* You can look through the existing bugs here: https://github.com/ketch/polo/issues
